<summary>What can I do if my database provider is not available in the options in bqckup?</summary>

Currently, bqckup only supports **MySQL** and **PostGRE** as database providers. If the database provider you are using is not available in the options, you can submit a feature request to the bqckup, or even contribute to adding the feature yourself.

<summary>How can I connect my Google Drive, Dropbox, etc to bqckup?</summary>

Bqckup was created based on the issues we experienced, and we use S3 as a storage for the data. You can read an article that I have written [here](https://medium.com/@thisnugroho/we-creating-a-secure-backup-solution-for-peace-of-mind-31b9963975b8), which explains why we chose to use S3 over Google Drive. However, if you do require this feature, please do not hesitate to submit a feature request and we will review whether it is necessary to add or not. or, you can contribute by adding this feature to Bqckup ðŸ˜€
